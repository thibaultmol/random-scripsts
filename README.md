USE ANY OF THESE SCRIPTS AT YOUR OWN RISK. THEY WORK ON MY MACHINE, BUT MIGHT NOT ON YOURS. I'M NOT LIABLE FOR ANYTHING THAT HAPPENS.
Most of these scripts will be fully/partially be made with GPT-4 probably. Which I handhold to make these scripts, so it *should* be fine.
But you're on your own if it goes south for you


The [archiveteamcontainers.sh](archiveteamcontainers.sh) script is a bash script to run a bunch of Archiveteam grabbers.
Allows you to select how many containers of each type of grabbers you want to launch.
Also auto pauses if you're on a laptop and you switch to battery.
